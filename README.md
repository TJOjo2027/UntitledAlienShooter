# Untitled Alien Shooter

### ABOUT ###

Welcome to **Untitled Alien Shooter** — a retro-inspired arcade game built with **Python** and **Pygame**.

This project showcases my programming and computer science skills through the creation of a full desktop game. It’s designed as both a fun experience and a foundation for deeper AI experimentation.

---

### PROJECT PURPOSE ###

The ultimate goal of this project is to build an environment where a **Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)** AI can train and learn to outperform average human players.

I plan to distribute the game to friends, gather their high scores, and use those scores as performance benchmarks for the AI to beat.

---

### BETA TESTING ###

Currently in **beta**, this game is being shared with testers to:

- Collect feedback and bug reports
- Receive high scores to serve as AI training goals
- Identify areas for visual and gameplay improvement

---

### VISUAL & UX GOALS ###

Aside from the AI integration, this project is also a way for me to learn how to:

- Build clean and polished desktop applications in Python
- Implement smooth transitions and game animations
- Enhance the overall design and user experience over time

---

### TECHNOLOGIES USED ###

- Python 3
- Pygame
- PyInstaller (for packaging the game into an executable)

---

### HOW TO PLAY ###

A downloadable version and installation guide will be made available soon. Stay tuned for future updates.

---

### FUTURE PLANS ###

- Add Deep Reinforcement Learning AI integration
- Improve UI with better menus, animations, and transitions
- Add settings menu for sound, difficulty, and control customization
- Create a leaderboard to compare player and AI performance

---

### STAY TUNED ###

Follow the project as it evolves into a full-featured game and AI training environment.
